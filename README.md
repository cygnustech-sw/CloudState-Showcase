# CloudState™ Showcase

Welcome to the **CloudState™ Showcase Repository**.

This repository provides a high-level, non-sensitive demonstration of **CloudState™**, a multi-cloud inventory, insights, and governance toolkit developed by **CygnusTech Ltd**.

The purpose of this showcase is to illustrate what CloudState™ produces using synthetic, de-identified data and representative artefacts—without exposing any private source code or customer information.
